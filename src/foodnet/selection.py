"""Which experiments a search looks at: media, experiment ids, study ids (#113).

Karoline, 2026-10-04, weakening her earlier stance against environment filtering now that foodnet exports
gLV parameters ("it's one thing to export a network of known interactions and another to do a gLV
simulation"): "a second, optional, input field next to the first one with the taxa. Users can either
specify names of media or a list of experiment identifiers there ... The media will have to be
string-matched against the experiment description; they are not systematically provided by mGrowthDB."

What the box takes, one entry per line, matched with OR:

  * an **experiment id** (`EMGDB000000031`) or a **study id** (`SMGDB00000004`), recognized by their shape;
  * anything else is a **medium**, matched case-insensitively as a substring.

A medium is matched against three things, because mGrowthDB spreads the environment over them. Every
experiment today does carry a structured `mediumName` on its compartments (559 of 559 when this was
written), so that is matched first; the spellings differ between studies though (Wilkins-Chalgren appears
four ways, one of them misspelled), which is why the match is a substring and not an equality. The
experiment's description and name are matched too, since what distinguishes experiments inside one study
lives only there: study 2 runs BT_WC and BT_MUCIN on one medium, study 4 runs +Ac and -Ac.

Selecting does not change how an interaction is derived. A comparison already never mixes media, because
the compartment record that carries the medium is part of the conditions two replicate sets must share
(`derive.conditions`). This is a way of looking at less, not a different method.
