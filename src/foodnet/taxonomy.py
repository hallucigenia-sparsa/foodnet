"""Resolve species names to NCBI taxon ids, from mGrowthDB's own records.

mGrowthDB queries take NCBI taxon ids (`MGrowthDBClient.search`), while people type species names. Every
strain in mGrowthDB carries its taxon id (`NCBId` on an experiment's community strains), so the mapping is
built from the database itself: no second external service, and only names that mGrowthDB actually holds,
which are the only ones with data to find.

`species_index` crawls the studies once (the client caches responses, on disk when a cache_dir is set) and
returns genus and species keys mapped to the taxon ids seen under them. `resolve_species` turns what a
person typed, names or numeric taxon ids, into ids, and reports what mGrowthDB does not hold.

Nothing pulled here is written into the repository (see docs/DATA_GOVERNANCE.md).
