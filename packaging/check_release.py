"""Check a release tag before anything is published, and write its release notes (grownet #27).

Usage: python packaging/check_release.py v0.1.0 notes.md

The tag must be v plus the version in pyproject.toml, the package's __version__ must be the same,
CITATION.cff must name that version, and CHANGELOG.md must hold a section for it that is no longer marked
unreleased. The notes file gets that section, for the GitHub release, after a paragraph on starting the
Windows program.

CITATION.cff is checked because 0.1.0 shipped while it still said 0.0.2: nothing read it, so nothing
caught it, and a citation that misstates the version is exactly the kind of thing a reader trusts.
