"""The entry point of the self-contained program (the Windows build, #26).

Double-clicked, with no arguments, it opens the local page in the browser, as `foodnet gui` does, and the
console window it runs in shows the address and stops the tool when it is closed. Given arguments it is
the command line: `foodnet.exe derive ...`, `foodnet.exe gui --port 8765`, and options alone go to the page
(`foodnet.exe --no-browser`). A message that stops it, such as a port already in use, stays on screen until
Enter is pressed, since a double-clicked window would otherwise close before it could be read.
